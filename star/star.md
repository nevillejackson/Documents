#### Thoughts on meaning of Star of Bethlehem ####
We all know the story of the Three Wise Men following a 'star' to Bethlehem,

but
have we ever stopped to ask why  anyone would look to a 'star'  for guidance?
The answer lies in the world outlook and customs of people in the Ancient World.
I consulted my book ...

Yes it is battered... 1967 edition.
It seems the Israelites, and Greeks, and Romans, and probably many before them, 
saw natural events as messages....
in much the same way as we today might view a roadsign or a computer popup message. 
Natural events were like computer interrupts ... " stop what you are doing and attend to something else"

So following  our Star of Bethlehem would not have been an outlandish thing for 
our Three Wise Men to undertake. They were , after all, Astrologers. They believed events in the heavens could influence our life on Earth. The story would have been accepted in 1AD without a second thought., and it infiltrated out literature for centuries after

We have inherited this idea of 'signs'. It is part of our legacy from the Ancient world.  
Our 'signs' today are based on the things we believe in today 
.... measurements predicting climate events, computer error messages telling us to stop and correct something. We also have a legacy of treating stars as symbols of hope and guidance.

Some may say that our 'signs' are correct, while the natural 'signs' used by the Ancients were misconceived.  That is a harsh judgement, and it is not my point.  My point is that use of signs is a universal human attribute. We all understand the following

because the signs used are part of today's culture.

There is , of course, the special Christian interpretation  of the Star of Bethlehem as a supernatural event, and a message about an even greater supernatural event. I shall leave that for you to contemplate. Whether our 'star' represents divine guidance is an open question, but it definitely represents guidance.
