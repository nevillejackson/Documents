### CHRISTIAN BELIEF ABOUT HEAVEN AND HELL ###

by
Dorothy Sayers

 If we are to understand the Christian doctrine
about what happens at death, we must first
rid our minds of every concept of time and space
as we know them. Our time and space have
no independent reality: they belong to the
universe and were created with it. Take down
any novel you like from the shelf. The story
it tells. may cover the events of a few hours or
of many years; it may range over a few acres
or the whole globe, But all that space-time is
contained within the covers of the book, and
has no contact at any point with the space-time
in which you are living: It, and the whole universe of
 action which goes on inside the book,
are made things, deriving their existence from
the mind of their maker.



 Christians believe that our universe of space
and time is, similarly, a made thing. It is
quite “real” so far as it goes, but its reality is
dependent on that of its Maker, who is alone
real in His own right. They also believe that
the soul of Man has been so made that it is
capable of entering into the true Reality which
we call “Heaven” or “the presence of God.”
So that when we die, it is not as though the
characters and action of the book were 
“continued in our next” like a serial; it is as
though they came out from the book to partake
of the real existence of their author.

If this real existence involves anything at all
corresponding to “time” and “space,” these
do not coincide with ours in any way, and we
can have no conception of them. We call them
“eternity” and “infinity” simply to mark
their total unlikeness to anything that we
experience; and when we speak of God's
“time” as an “eternal present” we mean to
exclude every idea of duration in *our* time.




 All this was understood and insisted on by
instructed Christians up to the end of the
Middle Ages (e.g. by Boethius in the sixth
century and Dante in the fourteenth). It was
only after the Reformation and the Renaissance
of Learning that childishly literal notions of a
localised Heaven extended in measurable time
began to creep out of popular mythology into
the minds of educated people.

 Accordingly, Christians do not very much
care for the term “survival,” which suggests a
continuation along the old lines of space and
time. It is less misleading to speak of coming
out of time into eternity. Heaven is the abiding
 contemplation of, and union with, that total
perfection which we call “God,” who is the
unconditioned Reality containing and upholding 
the conditioned realities of the space-time
universe which He made.

It is in this sense that we speak of Christianity 
as an “other-worldly” religion — not
because it denies the significance and importance 
of the created universe, but because it
places the centre of reality not within that universe, 
but in God. Our senses, assisted by the
sciences; teach us to follow “the story" from
inside, and to see it as an orderly sequence of
events; and as such it, will appear to be a
self-contained network of cause and effect. But
the *real* cause of those events — the intention in
the mind of the author — can only be very dimly
inferred from the data within the story, unless
the author should choose. to reveal himself by
becoming a character within his own creation;
and this, of course, Christians believe that our
Maker has done. 

But in this life, as T. S. Eliot has said,
“Human kind cannot bear very much reality,
We have to be trained to encounter it.” It is
not merely that, being finite, we cannot apprehend 
reality, but that, being sinful, we are unwilling 
to accept it, For, to accept reality, it is
necessary to acknowledge that the source and
centre of our being is not in ourselves, but in
God. Sin is the self-sufficiency which urges us
to reject this idea and to delude ourselves with
the flattering fantasy that Man’s being is centred
in himself — that he can be “as God.” Thus our
outlook is not only finite, but violently distorted,
and evils are called into existence — evils which,
though from the point of view of eternal reality
they are seen to be lies and illusions, yet within
the created frame of things are, unhappily, quite
as real as anything else in the material universe.

Our “training” to encounter reality is thus
made much more difficult by our insistence on
clinging to a false idea of the self. We have
not only everything to learn, but also much to
unlearn. The will and judgment need to be
purged as well as strengthened before we can
become possessed of our true selves and endure
to enter the heavenly presence of God, where
we shall “know even as we are known.” This
training is the work of time, and its aim is the
freeing of the will and judgment from those
errors and perversions which render it incapable
of facing the Divine Reality. 

If the training is not completed at the time
of death, it will have to be completed after
death; that is why any attempt to hold the
spirits “earthbound" — by “calling them up”
at seances, of even by importunate and possessive 
grief — is to do them wrong by delaying
their entry into beatitude. But sooner or later,
if beatitude is what we truly want, we shall get
it; for it is what God wants for us and, as St.
Paul says, no created thing, whether of time,
space or spirit, can separate us from His love.

But do we truly want it? At bottom — yes,
we do, for it is the end for which we were made
and without which we cannot be happy or complete, 
“In every soul that shall be saved,”
said the Lady Julian of Norwich, “there is a
godly will that never assented to sin, nor ever
shall,” ‘and it is this will which has to be set
free so that it may become united to God,

           `      *           *           * `

 There remains, however, the terrible possibility
that the continual indulgence of the false self
may so weaken the true God-ward will that it
becomes impotent, so that, in the moment of
death which is the moment of final choice, the
soul will shrink away from the presence of
God and refuse beatitude. If so, we shall have
what we have willed to have. We shall have
to live for ever with the sinful self that we
have chosen; and this is called Hell.

 God sends nobody to Hell; only a wicked
ignorance can suggest that He would do to us
the very thing He died to save us from. But
He has so made us that what in the end we
choose, that in the end we shall have. If we
enter the state called Hell, it is because we have
willed to do so.

 Neither can He force any soul into beatitnde
against its will; for He has nothing but Himself
 to give it, and it is precisely the light of
His presence which the self-centred soul can
know only as burning and judgment. So the
Lady Julian said that in her visions she “saw
no Hell but Sin,” and St. Catherine of Genoa
said that the fire of the torment was the light
of God as experienced by those who reject it.

     `       *            *            * `

Christians believe that “in the end of the world”
God will make “a new heaven and a new earth,”
and that the body will then be raised from the
dead and be united to the soul, so that the whole
man will be restored in his completeness. About
this we know very little. The only resurrection
body of which we have any knowledge is that of
the risen Christ, and it is clear from the Gospel
narrative that, although it could manifest itself
in our time and space, its relation to them was
of a very special kind, and that it did not belong
to our universe at all. St. Paul calls the resurrection 
body “a spiritual body,” and stresses
its  *difference*;  “It is sown in corruption, it is
raised in incorruption : it is sown in weakness,
it is raised in power.”

In any case, we need not puzzle our wits to
find a time and place for it within the universe,
because, in the end of time, that universe “shall
be rolled: together as a scroll" (that is, as a
reader shuts up a volume when he has finished
with it), and God will wiite a new book.
