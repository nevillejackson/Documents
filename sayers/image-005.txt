the risen Christ, and it is clear from the Gospel
narrative that, although it could manifest itself
in our time and space, its relation to them was
of a very special kind, and that it did not belong
to our universe at all. St. Paul calls the resur-
rection body “a spiritual body,” and stresses
its  DIFFERENCE;  “It is sown in corruption, it is
raised in incorruption : it is sown in weakness,
it is raised in power.”

In any case, we need not puzzle our wits to
find a time and place for it within the universe,
because, in the end of time, that universe “shall
be rolled: together as a scroll" (that is, as a
reader shuts up a volume when he has finished
with it), and God will wiite a new book.
