CHRISTIAN BELIEF ABOUT
HEAVEN AND HELL

by
Dorothy Sayers

 If we are to understand the Christian doctrine
about what happens at death, we must first
rid our minds of every concept of time and space
as we know them. Our time and space have
no independent reality: they belong to the
universe and were created with it. Take down
any novel you like from the shelf. The story
it tells. may cover the events of a few hours or
of many years; it may range over a few acres
or the whole globe, But all that space-time is
contained within the covers of the book, and
has no contact at any point with the space-time
in which you are living: It, and the whole uni-
verse of action which goes on inside the book,
are made things, deriving their existence from
the mind of their maker.
